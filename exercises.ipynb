        "2. **Implemented tuple-based state transitions** for multi-word contexts\n",

        "- **k=1**: Traditional single-word Markov chains `\"word\" → [\"next1\", \"next2\", ...]`\n",
        "- **k=2**: Two-word context states `(\"word1\", \"word2\") → [\"next1\", \"next2\", ...]` \n",
        "- **k=3**: Three-word context states for maximum coherence\n",

        "### Results Summary:\n",
        "- **Higher k values produce more coherent text** but require larger training corpora\n",
        "- **k=3 generates the most natural-sounding sentences** in our tests\n",
        "- **The sliding window approach** maintains context throughout generation\n",
